Files: src/core/app.js, index.html
Prompt: "Caveat: The messages below were generated by the user while running local commands... Context: We just converted index-v3-loop-markers-v31.html into a modular structure where all HTML is in index.html and all JavaScript (4394 lines) is in src/core/app.js as a single ES6 module. The app successfully loads 90 files from Supabase with tags displaying and all v31 controls present with no console errors."

Initial request: Test if clicking a file loads audio and plays correctly.

Follow-up: "Should everything on the page be functional now, or is that something that we are about to implement? It doesn't seem like the tags at the top right under the search bar are clickable. It doesn't seem like our Shift functionality, which helps correct the marker placement to the actual proper downbeat of bars or 4/8-bar sections of the waveform. There's probably also a couple other things that are messed up. I'm not sure if I need to test everything now or what the plan is."

Changes:
- Fixed ES6 module scoping issue preventing inline onclick handlers from working
- Exposed 11 functions to global window object in src/core/app.js (lines 4396-4407):
  - handleFileClick, handleTagClick, toggleShowAllTags
  - handleBPMClick, handleKeyClick, handleSort
  - toggleFileSelection, openStemsViewer, generateStems
  - quickEditFile, addModalTag, handleSearchKeydown
- Created backup system: src/core/app.js Backups/app_v1.js
- Tested all core functionality: tag filtering, file loading, playback, markers, shift controls
- All v31 features confirmed working in ES6 module structure
