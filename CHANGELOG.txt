=== Version 1 ===
Date: 2025-10-14
Files: src/core/app.js, index.html
Prompt: "Caveat: The messages below were generated by the user while running local commands... Context: We just converted index-v3-loop-markers-v31.html into a modular structure where all HTML is in index.html and all JavaScript (4394 lines) is in src/core/app.js as a single ES6 module. The app successfully loads 90 files from Supabase with tags displaying and all v31 controls present with no console errors."

Initial request: Test if clicking a file loads audio and plays correctly.

Follow-up: "Should everything on the page be functional now, or is that something that we are about to implement? It doesn't seem like the tags at the top right under the search bar are clickable. It doesn't seem like our Shift functionality, which helps correct the marker placement to the actual proper downbeat of bars or 4/8-bar sections of the waveform. There's probably also a couple other things that are messed up. I'm not sure if I need to test everything now or what the plan is."

Changes:
- Fixed ES6 module scoping issue preventing inline onclick handlers from working
- Exposed 11 functions to global window object in src/core/app.js (lines 4396-4407):
  - handleFileClick, handleTagClick, toggleShowAllTags
  - handleBPMClick, handleKeyClick, handleSort
  - toggleFileSelection, openStemsViewer, generateStems
  - quickEditFile, addModalTag, handleSearchKeydown
- Created backup system: src/core/app.js Backups/app_v1.js
- Tested all core functionality: tag filtering, file loading, playback, markers, shift controls
- All v31 features confirmed working in ES6 module structure

Result: ✅ SUCCESS - All functionality working

=== Version 2 ===
Date: 2025-10-14
Files: src/core/config.js, src/core/utils.js, src/core/app.js
Prompt: "We're continuing development of the Audio Library Claude project... Next Mission: Break down the monolithic 4394-line app.js into proper ES6 modules while maintaining ALL working functionality."

Changes (ROUND 1 - Foundation Modules):
- Created src/core/config.js:
  - Supabase client initialization (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, supabase)
  - PREF_KEYS constants for localStorage preferences
- Created src/core/utils.js:
  - extractTagsFromFilename() - Parse filename for tags, BPM, key
  - getAudioDuration() - Get audio file duration
  - calculateBPMFromOnsets() - Calculate BPM from onset positions
  - getAllTags() - Get all unique tags with counts
  - getTagCount() - Count files with specific tag
  - getAllBPMs() - Get all unique BPMs with counts
  - getAllKeys() - Get all unique keys with counts
  - getShiftIncrement() - Get shift increment based on marker frequency
  - findNearestMarkerToLeft() - Find nearest marker to left of time
  - getBarIndexAtTime() - Get bar index at given time
  - getTimeForBarIndex() - Get time for given bar index
  - formatTime() - Format seconds to MM:SS
- Modified src/core/app.js:
  - Added ES6 imports for config.js and utils.js
  - Removed duplicate PREF_KEYS declaration
  - Removed duplicate pendingUploadFiles declaration
  - Kept utility function definitions in place (will be removed in later rounds)
- Created backups: app_v2.js, app_v3.js, app_v4.js, index_v2.html, index_v3.html

Testing Results:
✅ Page loads without errors (only harmless favicon.ico 404)
✅ Files load from Supabase (90 files displayed)
✅ Tag filtering works (CAN/MUST/EXCLUDE modes)
✅ File playback works (audio loads and plays)
✅ Bar markers toggle on/off correctly
✅ Shift controls work (marker adjustment)
✅ Player controls work (play/pause/volume/rate)

Git Commits: 9b92369, cbceb1b, dd77004
Result: ✅ SUCCESS - All functionality working with modular config and utils

=== Version 3 ===
Date: 2025-10-14
Files: src/core/metronome.js, src/core/app.js
Prompt: "Continue modularization - extract metronome functionality"

Changes (ROUND 2 - Metronome Module):
- Created src/core/metronome.js (254 lines):
  - initMetronomeAudioContext() - Initialize Web Audio API context
  - stopAllMetronomeSound() - Stop all scheduled metronome sounds
  - playMetronomeSound() - Main metronome sound dispatcher
  - playClickSound() - Generate click sound (sharp transient)
  - playBeepSound() - Generate beep sound (sine wave)
  - playWoodSound() - Generate wood sound (filtered noise)
  - playCowbellSound() - Generate cowbell sound (dual square waves)
  - scheduleMetronome() - Schedule upcoming beats with rate compensation
  - toggleMetronome() - Toggle metronome on/off with button state
  - setMetronomeSound() - Change metronome sound type
  - State getters/setters for integration with app.js
- Modified src/core/app.js:
  - Added ES6 import for metronome.js
  - Replaced 228 lines of metronome code with 2 wrapper functions
  - Updated all metronome state access to use module API
  - Removed metronome state variable declarations
  - Reduced from 4394 to 4228 lines (166 lines net reduction)
- Created backups: app_v5.js, app_v6.js

Testing Results:
✅ Metronome toggle works (k key)
✅ Sound selection works (click, beep, wood, cowbell)
✅ Sync with beatmap data accurate
✅ Playback rate compensation working
✅ Scheduling and cleanup functioning properly

Git Commit: f7cdbdf
Result: ✅ SUCCESS - Metronome module extracted and working perfectly
