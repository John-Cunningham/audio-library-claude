Prompt: "Caveat: The messages below were generated by the user while running local commands... Context: We just converted index-v3-loop-markers-v31.html into a modular structure where all HTML is in index.html and all JavaScript (4394 lines) is in src/core/app.js as a single ES6 module. The app successfully loads 90 files from Supabase with tags displaying and all v31 controls present with no console errors."

Initial request: Test if clicking a file loads audio and plays correctly.

Follow-up: "Should everything on the page be functional now, or is that something that we are about to implement? It doesn't seem like the tags at the top right under the search bar are clickable. It doesn't seem like our Shift functionality, which helps correct the marker placement to the actual proper downbeat of bars or 4/8-bar sections of the waveform. There's probably also a couple other things that are messed up. I'm not sure if I need to test everything now or what the plan is."

Changes:
- Fixed ES6 module scoping issue preventing inline onclick handlers from working
- Exposed 11 functions to global window object in src/core/app.js (lines 4396-4407):
  - handleFileClick, handleTagClick, toggleShowAllTags
  - handleBPMClick, handleKeyClick, handleSort
  - toggleFileSelection, openStemsViewer, generateStems
  - quickEditFile, addModalTag, handleSearchKeydown
- Created backup system: src/core/app.js Backups/app_v1.js
- Tested all core functionality: tag filtering, file loading, playback, markers, shift controls
- All v31 features confirmed working in ES6 module structure

Git Commits: 42394cf, b1b9752
Result: ‚úÖ SUCCESS - All functionality working

=== Version 4 ===
Date: 2025-10-14
Files: src/core/app.js
Prompt: "Fix metronome sync issue - when changing playback rate while metronome is playing, ensure clicks stay on beats"

Changes:
- Added immediate metronome rescheduling in setPlaybackRate():
  - Calls Metronome.scheduleMetronome() immediately after rate change
  - Updates lastMetronomeScheduleTime to prevent duplicate scheduling
- Improves rate-change sync but phase alignment edge case remains
- Edge case deferred: clicks at correct tempo but offset from beats (workaround: stop/restart playback)
- Created backup: app_v7.js, app_v8.js

Testing Results:
‚úÖ Metronome tempo adjusts with rate changes
‚ö†Ô∏è Known edge case: phase offset after rate change (deferred to backlog)

Git Commit: 83deea5

=== Version 6 ===
Date: 2025-10-14
Files: src/core/app.js, index.html
Prompt: "Phase 4 Step 1: Implement basic stems expansion UI (no playback yet)"

Changes (Phase 4 Step 1 - Stems Expansion UI):
- Added expandedStems Set to track which files have expanded stems
- Modified openStemsViewer() to toggle inline expansion instead of opening new window
- Modified renderFiles() to include stems expansion container below each file
- Stems expansion shows 4 cards in 2x2 grid:
  - üé§ Vocals - placeholder waveform
  - ü•Å Drums - placeholder waveform
  - üé∏ Bass - placeholder waveform
  - üéπ Other - placeholder waveform
- Added CSS animations for stems expansion (.stems-expansion slideDown animation)
- Added CSS for expanded stems icon (.stems-icon.expanded rotates 180deg)
- Stems icon title changes to "Hide stems" when expanded
- File row border-radius adjusts when stems are expanded
- Created backups: app_v12.js, index_v7.html

=== Version 7 ===
Date: 2025-10-14
Files: src/core/app.js
Prompt: "Phase 4 Step 2A: Load stems in background and play them instead of main file"

Changes (Phase 4 Step 2A - Background Stem Playback):
- Added stem state variables:
  - stemWavesurfers {} - WaveSurfer instance per stem type
  - stemFiles {} - Cached stem file data from audio_files_stems
  - stemMuted, stemSoloed, stemVolumes - Per-stem control state
- Created stem playback functions:
  - fetchStemFiles() - Query audio_files_stems table by parent file ID
  - destroyAllStems() - Clean up all stem WaveSurfer instances
  - createStemWaveSurfer() - Create hidden WaveSurfer for each stem
  - loadStems() - Load all 4 stems and wait for ready state
  - syncStemsWithMain() - Sync stem play/pause/seek with main WaveSurfer
  - updateStemAudioState() - Apply solo/mute logic to stems
- Modified loadAudio():
  - Check if file has_stems=true
  - If yes: fetch stem files, create 4 WaveSurfer instances, sync with main
  - Mute main WaveSurfer (volume=0) since stems are playing instead
  - If stems load fails: fallback to playing main file
  - Destroy stems when changing files
- Stem sync behavior:
  - Main play ‚Üí all stems play
  - Main pause ‚Üí all stems pause
  - Main seek ‚Üí all stems seek to same position
  - Main finish ‚Üí all stems seek to 0
- Created backup: app_v13.js

Implementation Notes:
- Stems load in hidden containers (display:none)
- Main WaveSurfer shows visual waveform but plays at volume=0
- All 4 stems play simultaneously (you hear the mixed stems, not main file)
- Stems stay perfectly synced with main playback position
- Solo/mute logic ready (not yet exposed in UI)

Git Commits: 82712f5
Result: ‚úÖ SUCCESS - Background stem playback working (play/pause/seek synced)
Known Issues: Rate and volume sliders only affecting main WaveSurfer (fixed in Version 8)

=== Version 8 ===
Date: 2025-10-14
Files: src/core/app.js
Prompt: "Fix rate and volume sliders to affect all stem WaveSurfers"

Changes (Phase 4 Step 2A - Rate and Volume Fix):
- Modified setVolume() function (lines 3531-3567):
  - Now iterates over all stem WaveSurfers and applies master volume
  - Respects per-stem volume and solo/mute state
  - Multi-solo support: if any stems are soloed, only soloed stems get volume
  - Otherwise, respects individual mute states
  - Final volume calculation: masterVolume * stemVolume * (solo/mute logic)
- Modified setPlaybackRate() function (lines 3596-3633):
  - Now iterates over all stem WaveSurfers and applies playback rate
  - All 4 stems change speed/pitch together with main WaveSurfer
  - Metronome sync still works correctly
- Created backup: app_v14.js

Testing Results:
[Pending user testing]
- Rate slider should affect all 4 stems
- Volume slider should affect all 4 stems
- Solo/mute logic should work correctly (ready for UI controls)

Git Commits: 57a3157

Known Issues: Phase drift causing weird audio quality (fixed in Version 9)

=== Version 9 ===
Date: 2025-10-14
Files: src/core/app.js
Prompt: "Fix phase drift when changing rate - stems getting out of sync causing weird audio quality"

Changes (Phase 4 Step 2A - Phase Drift Fix):
- Modified setPlaybackRate() function (lines 3596-3669):
  - Added phase drift prevention logic when stems are loaded and playing
  - Algorithm:
    1. Pause all stems before rate change (prevents drift during change)
    2. Apply rate change to main + all stem WaveSurfers
    3. Re-sync all stems to main WaveSurfer position (seekTo same progress)
    4. Resume playback with 50ms delay (ensures rate changes are applied)
  - Only applies sync logic when stems are loaded AND playing
  - Non-stem files unaffected (no extra processing)
- Created backup: app_v15.js

Technical Details:
- Phase drift occurs when rate changes happen sequentially on multiple WaveSurfers
- Small timing differences accumulate, causing phase cancellation
- Solution: Pause ‚Üí Change ‚Üí Sync ‚Üí Resume (all stems stay perfectly aligned)
- 50ms delay ensures Web Audio API has time to process rate changes

Testing Results:
[Pending user testing]
- Rate changes should not cause weird audio quality
- Returning to 1.0x should sound identical to original
- Stems should stay perfectly in phase at all rates

Git Commits: b7d6cd7
Result: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL - Somewhat improved, on-the-fly changes still have drift (deferred)

=== Version 10 ===
Date: 2025-10-14
Files: src/core/app.js
Prompt: "Phase 4 Step 2B: Replace placeholder waveforms with real stem waveforms"

Changes (Phase 4 Step 2B - Real Stem Waveforms):
- Modified stems expansion HTML (lines 1734-1776):
  - Replaced "Waveform placeholder" divs with real container divs
  - Container IDs: stem-waveform-{vocals|drums|bass|other}-{fileId}
  - Increased height from 40px to 60px for better visibility
  - Added overflow:hidden for clean appearance
- Created renderStemWaveforms() function (lines 2000-2047):
  - Renders visual-only WaveSurfer instances in expansion containers
  - Loads actual stem audio files for waveform visualization
  - No interaction or playback (visual only)
  - Separate from hidden playback WaveSurfers
- Modified openStemsViewer() function (lines 1994-1997):
  - Calls renderStemWaveforms() after expansion with 100ms delay
  - Only renders if stems are loaded and expansion is for current file
- Created backup: app_v16.js

Implementation Notes:
- Audio playback: Hidden WaveSurfer instances (Step 2A)
- Visual waveforms: Visible WaveSurfer instances (Step 2B)
- 4 stem types: vocals, drums, bass, other
- Waveforms load asynchronously when expansion opens

Testing Results:
[Pending user testing]
- Expand stems on a playing file with stems
- Should see real waveforms instead of placeholders
- Waveforms should load within 1-2 seconds

Git Commits: 96283e5
Result: ‚úÖ SUCCESS - Real stem waveforms rendering correctly
Known Issue: Seeking causes only 'other' stem to play (fixed in Version 11)

=== Version 11 ===
Date: 2025-10-14
Files: src/core/app.js
Prompt: "Fix seeking bug - after seeking, only 'other' stem plays instead of all 4 stems"

Changes (Phase 4 Step 2B - Seeking Fix):
- Modified syncStemsWithMain() seeking event handler (lines 320-343):
  - Added pause-before-seek logic to prevent audio glitches
  - Track if main WaveSurfer was playing before seek
  - Pause all stem WaveSurfers before seeking
  - Apply seek to all stems
  - Resume playback with 50ms delay if was playing
  - Ensures all 4 stems resume after seek, not just one
- Created backup: app_v17.js

Bug Details:
- User reported: "if I click on the waveform to seek, I then am only hearing the 'other' stem"
- Root cause: Stems not resuming playback after seek operation
- Only last stem in forEach loop was resuming correctly

Testing Results:
[Pending user testing]
- Seek while playing should resume all 4 stems
- All stems should stay in sync after seek
- No audio glitches during seek

Git Commits: 3d46bec
Result: ‚ùå FAILED - Broke seeking, stems reset to beginning (fixed in Version 12)

=== Version 12 ===
Date: 2025-10-14
Files: src/core/app.js
Prompt: "Fix seeking regression - clicking waveform resets all stems to beginning instead of seeking to clicked position"

Changes (Phase 4 Step 2B - Seeking Fix v2):
- Simplified syncStemsWithMain() seeking logic (lines 297-333):
  - Removed complex pause/resume logic that was breaking seeks
  - Added stemsWerePlaying variable tracked by play/pause events
  - Seeking event now just applies seekTo() to all stems
  - Let WaveSurfer's own play/pause events handle resume
  - Much simpler and more reliable approach
- Created backup: app_v18.js

Bug Details:
- Version 11 broke seeking - stems were resetting to beginning
- Root cause: Over-complicated pause/resume logic in seeking event
- Solution: Simple seekTo() call, let play/pause events handle the rest

Testing Results:
[Pending user testing]
- Seek to any position should work correctly
- All 4 stems should follow the seek position
- Playback should resume automatically if was playing

Files: src/core/app.js
Prompt: "Fix seeking - convert currentTime (seconds) to progress (0-1) for stemWS.seekTo()"

Changes (Phase 4 Step 2B - Seeking Fix v3 - FINAL):
- Modified syncStemsWithMain() seeking event handler (lines 325-338):
  - **Root cause identified**: WaveSurfer 'seeking' event passes currentTime in SECONDS
  - **stemWS.seekTo()** expects progress as a RATIO (0-1), not seconds
  - Added conversion: `progress = currentTime / duration`
  - Now correctly converts time to progress before seeking
- Removed debug logging after confirming fix works
- Created backup: app_v19.js

Bug Analysis:
- User debug output showed: seekTo(38.96) ‚Üí current time: 0
- 38.96 seconds was being passed directly to seekTo()
- seekTo() expects 0-1 range (e.g., 0.974 for 97.4% through file)
- Values >1 get clamped or reset to 0

Solution:
```javascript
const duration = wavesurfer.getDuration();
const progress = duration > 0 ? currentTime / duration : 0;
stemWS.seekTo(progress); // Now correct!
```

Testing Results:
‚úÖ User confirmed: "Okay, that fixed it. Thank you."
- Stems now seek to correct position
- All 4 stems stay in sync
- Playback resumes correctly

Changes (Phase 4 Step 2B - Vertical Layout):
- Modified stems expansion HTML (lines 1743-1805):
  - Changed from 2x2 grid to vertical stack (flex-direction: column)
  - Each stem now on its own row with full width
  - Layout: Icon | Label | Waveform | Controls
  - Increased waveform height from 60px to 80px
  - Added placeholder for controls section (<!-- Controls will go here -->)
  - Label has min-width: 60px for alignment
  - Waveform uses flex: 1 to fill available space
  - Gap between stems: 12px
- Created backup: app_v20.js

New Layout Structure:
```
üé§ Vocals  ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ [controls area]

=== Version 15 ===
Date: 2025-10-14
Files: index.html
Prompt: "Fix multi-stem player positioning - stems appearing in scrollable file list instead of fixed above bottom player bar"

Changes (Critical Position Fixed Bug Fix):
- Added missing stylesheet link to index.html:
  - <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/stems.css"> (line 7)
  - Placed in <head> section before inline <style> tag
  - Previously CSS file was never loaded, so position: fixed was never applied
- Root cause identified:
  - styles/stems.css contains critical .multi-stem-player CSS with position: fixed
  - Without this link, browser never saw the fixed positioning styles
  - Multi-stem player div fell back to default positioning (static)
  - Resulted in players appearing in scrollable content instead of fixed to viewport
- Created backup: index_v1.html

Implementation Notes:
- This was the critical missing piece from previous session
- Reference file visualizer_V37_mobile.html had this link present
- Debug document MULTI_STEM_PLAYER_DEBUG.md identified this as likely cause
- No JavaScript changes needed - pure CSS loading issue

Testing Instructions:
1. Refresh page (Command + Shift + R to clear cache)
2. Click file with stems icon
3. Click STEMS button on bottom player bar
4. Multi-stem player should now:
   - ‚úÖ Be fixed to viewport (like bottom player bar)

Files: styles/stems.css, src/core/app.js
Prompt: "Fix multi-stem player styling to match reference screenshot from visualizer_V37_mobile.html"

Changes (Multi-Stem Player Visual Redesign):
- Completely rewrote styles/stems.css to match reference implementation:
  - Removed old .multi-stem-player-container and nested structure
  - Implemented horizontal layout: Controls | Waveform | Info | Volume
  - Each stem bar is 100px height with rgba(15, 15, 15, 0.95) background
  - No gap between bars (gap: 0)
  - First bar has border-top, subtle borders between bars
  - Play button styled as gradient purple circle (38x38px)
  - Waveform uses flex: 1, height: 50px, subtle background
  - Typography and spacing matches reference exactly
- Modified src/core/app.js generateMultiStemPlayerBars():
  - Changed from nested container to direct appendChild to multiStemPlayer
  - Updated HTML structure to match reference:
    - .stem-player-controls (play-pause, mute, loop buttons)
    - .stem-player-waveform (flex: 1 waveform container)
    - .stem-player-info (filename and time display)
    - .stem-player-volume (speaker icon, slider, percentage)
  - Removed .stem-player-header and .stem-player-footer divs
  - Added filename truncation (> 30 chars)
  - Updated button IDs for consistency
- Updated WaveSurfer styling in initializeMultiStemPlayerWavesurfers():

Date: 2025-10-14
Files: src/core/app.js
Prompt: "Fix 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading length)' error when generating multi-stem player bars"

Changes (Fix stem filename property):
- Fixed generateMultiStemPlayerBars() to use correct database field:
  - Changed from `stemFile.name` to `stemFile.stem_file_name`
  - Added fallback to `stemType` if stem_file_name is missing
  - Error occurred because audio_files_stems table has `stem_file_name` field, not `name`
- Database schema clarification:
  - audio_files_stems fields: id, audio_file_id, stem_type, file_url, file_size,
    created_at, stem_file_name, bpm, key, empty_status
  - stem_file_name contains the actual filename (e.g., "crazed SYN...01 (other).mp3")
- Created backup: app_v22.js

Implementation Notes:
- This fix only affects the NEW multi-stem player (STEMS button)
- Does NOT affect existing STEMS icon (üéõÔ∏è) functionality in file list
- Two completely separate systems:
  1. STEMS Icon: openStemsViewer() ‚Üí inline expansion in file list
  2. STEMS Button: toggleMultiStemPlayer() ‚Üí fixed player at bottom
- Both systems use different variables and WaveSurfer instances

Prompt: "Make all 4 stem bars visible when STEMS button is clicked"

Changes (Hide bottom player controls when stems expanded):
- Moved STEMS button from Row 2 (controls) to Row 1 (waveform):
  - Positioned absolutely in top-right corner of waveform
  - Overlaid on waveform with semi-transparent background and blur
  - Remains accessible when Row 2 is hidden
- Modified toggleMultiStemPlayer() to hide/show controls row:
  - When expanding: hides Row 2 (all controls) ‚Üí more space for stem bars
  - When collapsing: shows Row 2 again ‚Üí normal player controls
  - Uses `bottomPlayer.children[1]` to target Row 2
  - Sets display: 'none' when expanded, display: 'flex' when collapsed
- Removed duplicate STEMS button from Row 2 (Marker Controls section)
- Created backups: index_v2.html, app_v23.js

Implementation Notes:
- Bottom player now has 2 modes:
  1. Normal mode: Row 1 (waveform) + Row 2 (all controls)
  2. Stems mode: Row 1 (waveform with STEMS button) + 4 stem bars above
- Parent waveform always visible in bottom player Row 1
- 4 stem bars get ~80px more vertical space (from hidden Row 2)
- Total height for stems: 4 bars √ó 100px = 400px fits in most viewports
- STEMS button styling: rgba(15, 15, 15, 0.9) with backdrop-filter: blur(4px)

User Experience:
- Click STEMS ‚Üí Controls disappear, 4 stem bars slide up
- All 4 stems visible immediately (no scrolling needed)
- Parent waveform stays in bottom bar for visual reference
- Click STEMS again ‚Üí Stem bars slide down, controls reappear

Git Commits: [pending]
Result: ‚è≥ Ready for testing - All 4 stem bars should be visible now

=== Version 19 ===
Date: 2025-10-14
Files: src/core/app.js
Prompt: "Implement fully functional multi-stem player controls with parent/stem synchronization"

User Request: "I want the bottom STEMS button to be the main way to load stems. Make it so clicking STEMS loads stems in background, switches audio from parent file to all 4 stems (avoiding double audio), and implements all controls (play/pause, mute, volume) for each stem individually."

Changes (Phase 1a + 1b - Core Multi-Stem Player Functionality):
- Added state variables for stem loading and sync:
  - multiStemReadyCount (track how many stems loaded)
  - multiStemAutoPlayOnReady (whether to auto-play when ready)
- Rewrote initializeMultiStemPlayerWavesurfers() function (lines 2325-2416):
  - Detects if parent player is playing before loading stems
  - Loads all 4 stems with proper WaveSurfer configuration
  - Tracks ready count and waits for all stems to load
  - When all ready: mutes parent player, plays all stems if parent was playing
  - Calls setupParentStemSync() to establish synchronization
- Created playAllStems() function (lines 2418-2430):
  - Plays all 4 stem WaveSurfers simultaneously
  - Updates play/pause button icons (|| when playing)
- Created pauseAllStems() function (lines 2432-2444):
  - Pauses all 4 stem WaveSurfers
  - Updates play/pause button icons (‚ñ∂ when paused)
- Created setupParentStemSync() function (lines 2446-2501):
  - Syncs parent play ‚Üí play all stems
  - Syncs parent pause ‚Üí pause all stems
  - Syncs parent seek ‚Üí seek all stems to same position
  - Audio process sync: keeps stems in sync with parent during playback
  - Prevents drift >0.01 seconds by resyncing to parent position
- Rewrote destroyMultiStemPlayerWavesurfers() function (lines 2503-2529):
  - Cleans up all event listeners before destroying
  - Destroys all stem WaveSurfer instances
  - Restores parent player volume (unmutes it)
  - Resets multiStemReadyCount to 0
- Updated toggleMultiStemPlay() function (lines 2531-2549):
  - Fixed icon element ID (stem-play-pause-icon-{stemType})
  - Added console logging for debugging
  - Properly toggles individual stem play/pause
- Updated toggleMultiStemMute() function (lines 2551-2589):
  - Saves volume before muting (ws._savedVolume)
  - Restores saved volume when unmuting
  - Updates mute button icon (üîá muted, üîä unmuted)
  - Updates volume slider and percentage display
  - Properly adds/removes 'active' class
- Updated handleMultiStemVolumeChange() function (lines 2613-2644):
  - Sets stem volume (0-100 range)
  - Updates percentage display
  - Updates mute button icon based on volume
  - Properly handles zero volume edge case
- Created backups: app_v1.js

Implementation Strategy:
- Parent player acts as "conductor" - controls all stems via sync events
- Stems are muted visually (parent waveform shows in bottom bar)
- Audio output: 4 stems only (parent at volume 0)
- Individual controls allow mixing stems independently
- All stems stay perfectly in sync via audioprocess monitoring

Technical Details:
- Parent-to-stems sync uses WaveSurfer events: play, pause, seeking
- Stem-to-parent sync uses audioprocess event with 0.01s tolerance
- Volume calculation respects individual stem volumes
- Mute state stored on WaveSurfer instance (ws._savedVolume)
- 50ms delays ensure Web Audio API processes changes

Testing Instructions:
1. Load a file with stems (has_stems = true)
2. Click STEMS button (‚ñ≤ STEMS) on bottom player
3. Wait for all 4 stems to load (console shows "All stems ready")
4. Verify parent audio mutes, stem audio plays
5. Test individual controls:
   - Play/Pause buttons per stem
   - Mute buttons per stem
   - Volume sliders per stem
6. Test parent player controls:
   - Play/pause should affect all stems
   - Seek should move all stems together
   - Rate changes should affect all stems

Git Commits: e5d9d50
Result: ‚è≥ READY FOR TESTING - Phase 1 complete, all core controls implemented

=== Version 20 ===
Date: 2025-10-14
Files: src/core/app.js, styles/stems.css
Prompt: "Fix formatTime reference error and layout issue where parent controls were hidden"

User Feedback:
1. ‚ùå formatTime error: "Uncaught ReferenceError: formatTime is not defined"
2. ‚ùå Layout issue: "Parent player controls get hidden when stems expand - I need all controls visible"
3. ‚úÖ Individual stem muting works
4. ‚úÖ Volume mixing works
5. ‚úÖ Seeking individually works

Changes (Bug Fixes):
- Fixed formatTime reference in stem timeupdate handler (line 2408):
  - Changed from `formatTime(...)` to `Utils.formatTime(...)`
  - formatTime is exported from utils.js and imported as Utils namespace
  - Now correctly displays time updates (e.g., "1:23 / 3:45") for each stem
- Fixed layout to keep all controls visible when stems expand:
  - Removed code that hides Row 2 (controls) in toggleMultiStemPlayer()
  - Updated stems.css bottom position from 100px to 180px
  - Multi-stem player now sits above FULL bottom player (waveform + controls)
  - All parent controls remain accessible when stems are expanded
- Created backups: app_v2.js, stems_v2.css

Layout Before (Broken):
```
‚îå‚îÄ 4 Stem Bars (400px)
‚îú‚îÄ Parent Waveform Row ‚úì visible
‚îî‚îÄ Parent Controls Row ‚úó HIDDEN ‚Üê Problem!
```

Layout After (Fixed):
```
‚îå‚îÄ 4 Stem Bars (400px)
‚îú‚îÄ Parent Waveform Row ‚úì visible
‚îî‚îÄ Parent Controls Row ‚úì visible ‚Üê Fixed!
```

Implementation Details:
- Bottom player total height ‚âà 180px (Row 1: ~100px + Row 2: ~80px)
- Multi-stem player positioned at `bottom: 180px`
- When collapsed: `translateY(calc(100% + 180px))` moves it off-screen
- When expanded: slides up to reveal all 4 stem bars above bottom player
- Parent player always remains visible and fully functional

Git Commits: 23fa54a
Result: ‚úÖ FIXED - formatTime error resolved, all controls now visible

=== Version 21 ===
Date: 2025-10-14
Files: src/core/app.js
Prompt: "Fix playback reset and double audio issues when clicking STEMS button"

User Feedback:
‚úÖ "When I have Cycle on the parent file, the playheads of the individual stems are following that"
‚ùå "When I click on the STEMS button, playback of the currently playing parent file gets reset"
‚ùå "Sometimes I'm still hearing the parent file and the stems play at the same time"

Changes (Seamless Audio Switching):
- Rewrote initializeMultiStemPlayerWavesurfers() for seamless switching (lines 2313-2428):
  - **Capture parent state BEFORE loading stems:**
    - parentWasPlaying (boolean)
    - parentCurrentTime (seconds)
    - parentProgress (0-1 ratio)
  - **When all stems ready - perform seamless switch:**
    1. Seek all stems to parent's current position (prevents reset)
    2. Mute parent player FIRST (prevents double audio)
    3. If parent was playing ‚Üí start all stems at synced position
    4. If parent was paused ‚Üí keep stems paused at position
    5. Set up ongoing parent-stem sync
  - Added 50ms delay after seeking before playing (ensures seek completes)
- Created backup: app_v3.js

Algorithm Flow:
```
1. User clicks STEMS button
2. Parent continues playing at position X
3. Stems load in background
4. When all stems ready:
   ‚îú‚îÄ Stems seek to position X
   ‚îú‚îÄ Parent mutes (volume = 0)
   ‚îú‚îÄ Stems start playing at position X
   ‚îî‚îÄ User hears seamless transition
```

Before (Broken):
- Stems always started at 0:00 (reset)
- Parent + stems played together briefly (double audio)
- User experience: jarring audio glitch

After (Fixed):
- Stems start at parent's current position (no reset)
- Parent mutes before stems play (no double audio)
- User experience: seamless audio switch

Console Output Example:
```

=== Version 22 ===
Date: 2025-10-14
Files: src/core/app.js
Prompt: "Fix double audio issue - old and new stem systems conflicting"

User Testing Results (Version 21):
‚ùå Scenario 1 (Playing): "I am still hearing double playback. Parent file + all four stems. They are also not exactly aligned."
‚úÖ Scenario 2 (Paused): "Yes that works, and I do not hear double playback"
‚ùå Scenario 3 (Cycle mode): "STEMS played back, but I heard double playback, and one was slightly behind the other"

Root Cause Analysis:
Found TWO separate stem systems running simultaneously:
1. **OLD system** (lines 235-400): `stemWavesurfers` - Auto-loads stems when file clicked
   - Line 4163: `await loadStems(fileId, false)` called automatically
   - Line 4168: `wavesurfer.setVolume(0)` mutes parent
   - These stems play in hidden containers
2. **NEW system** (lines 2313+): `stemPlayerWavesurfers` - Multi-stem player (STEMS button)
   - Loads stems when STEMS button clicked
   - Also mutes parent and plays stems
Result: Both systems load stems ‚Üí Double audio!

Changes (Disable Old System):
- Disabled auto-loading of old stem system (line 4163):
  - Changed `if (file.has_stems)` to `if (false && file.has_stems)`
  - Added comment explaining why it's disabled
  - Old system was causing double audio with new multi-stem player
- Added parent volume restoration when loading new file (lines 4123-4127):
  - Reads current volume from slider
  - Restores parent volume on 'ready' event
  - Ensures parent plays normally when stems are not expanded
  - Prevents parent from staying muted after collapsing stems
- Created backup: app_v4.js

Before (Two Systems Active):
```
User clicks file with stems:
  ‚îú‚îÄ OLD system loads 4 stems (hidden)
  ‚îú‚îÄ OLD system mutes parent
  ‚îî‚îÄ User clicks STEMS button:
      ‚îú‚îÄ NEW system loads 4 stems (visible)
      ‚îú‚îÄ NEW system tries to mute parent (already muted)
      ‚îî‚îÄ RESULT: 8 audio streams playing! (4 old + 4 new)
```

After (Only New System):
```
User clicks file with stems:
  ‚îú‚îÄ OLD system DISABLED
  ‚îú‚îÄ Parent plays normally with full volume
  ‚îî‚îÄ User clicks STEMS button:
      ‚îú‚îÄ NEW system loads 4 stems (visible)
      ‚îú‚îÄ NEW system mutes parent
      ‚îî‚îÄ RESULT: 4 audio streams (stems only) ‚úì
```

Implementation Notes:
- Old stem system still exists in codebase (lines 235-400)
- Could be useful for future features (e.g., inline stem expansion)
- For now, only multi-stem player (STEMS button) loads stems
- This ensures no conflicts and clean audio switching

Git Commits: c763f3c
Result: ‚úÖ FIXED - Double audio eliminated (only one stem system active)

=== Version 23 ===
Date: 2025-10-14
Files: src/core/app.js
Prompt: "Fix stemFiles empty - multi-stem player needs to fetch its own stem files"

User Testing Result (Version 22):
‚ùå Console showed: `stemFiles: {}` and "No stem file for vocals/drums/bass/other, skipping"
‚ùå No stems loaded even though file had stems
‚ùå Could not test any scenarios

Root Cause:
- `stemFiles` was being populated by the OLD stem system's `loadStems()` function
- We disabled the OLD system to fix double audio (Version 22)
- But the NEW multi-stem player was still trying to READ from `stemFiles`
- Result: Empty object, no stems found

Changes (Fetch Stems in Multi-Stem Player):
- Made `generateMultiStemPlayerBars()` async (line 2241)
- Added Supabase query to fetch stems when STEMS button clicked (lines 2252-2280):
  ```javascript
  const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('audio_files_stems')
      .select('*')
      .eq('audio_file_id', currentFileId);

  // Organize stems by type
  stemFiles = {};
  data.forEach(stem => {
      stemFiles[stem.stem_type] = stem;
  });
  ```
- Updated `toggleMultiStemPlayer()` to await async function (lines 2216-2223):
  - Uses `.then()` to handle promise
  - Catches errors gracefully
  - Animation happens after fetch completes
- Created backup: app_v5.js

Flow Now:
```
1. User clicks STEMS button
   ‚îî‚îÄ toggleMultiStemPlayer() called
       ‚îî‚îÄ generateMultiStemPlayerBars() async
           ‚îú‚îÄ Fetch stems from Supabase
           ‚îú‚îÄ Populate stemFiles object
           ‚îú‚îÄ Generate HTML for 4 stem bars
           ‚îî‚îÄ initializeMultiStemPlayerWavesurfers()
               ‚îú‚îÄ Create WaveSurfer for each stem
               ‚îî‚îÄ Set up sync with parent
```

Expected Console Output:
```
toggleMultiStemPlayer called
