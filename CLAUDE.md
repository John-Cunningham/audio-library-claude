## ✅ COMPLETED REFACTORING (V29)

### State Management
- ✅ **PlayerStateManager** (`src/state/playerStateManager.js`) - Centralized player state
- ✅ **LoopStateManager** (`src/state/loopStateManager.js`) - Centralized loop state
- ✅ **StemStateManager** (`src/state/stemStateManager.js`) - Centralized stem state

### Component Modules
- ✅ **LoopControls** - Loop UI and logic
- ✅ **AdvancedRateMode** - Speed/pitch controls
- ✅ **StemLegacyPlayer** - Legacy stem waveforms (deprecated)
- ✅ **ActionRecorder** - Loop action recording
- ✅ **FileLoader** - File loading service
- ✅ **WaveformGenerator** - Waveform rendering

### Architecture Pattern
- ✅ **Hybrid State**: Local cache + centralized state managers
- ✅ **Dependency Injection**: Modules accept state/callbacks
- ✅ **Thin Wrappers**: app.js coordinates, modules contain logic
- ✅ **No God Object**: Business logic extracted from app.js

**Result**: app.js reduced from ~6500 lines → ~1900 lines

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES FOR NEW CODE

### 1. FOLLOW MODULAR ARCHITECTURE
**DO NOT add large functions to app.js!**

If adding new functionality:
1. Create a new module in appropriate directory:
   - `src/components/` for UI components
   - `src/state/` for state management
   - `src/utils/` for utility functions
   - `src/services/` for service classes
2. Use dependency injection (pass state/callbacks)
3. Add thin wrapper in app.js (3-7 lines max)
4. Expose to window if needed by HTML

### 2. MULTI-VIEW REQUIREMENT
**App has 3 views** (Library working, Galaxy/Sphere planned):
- State must persist across view switches
- Player must work in all views
- Use state managers for shared state

### 3. USE EXISTING PATTERNS
- **State**: Use PlayerStateManager, LoopStateManager, StemStateManager
- **Components**: Follow existing component patterns
- **Coordination**: app.js coordinates, doesn't implement

git status

# 2. Pull latest (if working on shared branch)
git pull origin main

# 3. Create feature branch (recommended)
git checkout -b feature-name
```

```

### Testing
```bash
# Start local server (required for CORS)
python3 -m http.server 5500

# Test in browser
open http://localhost:5500/index.html

# Check console for errors
# Test: upload, play, stems, tags, filters
```

### Session End

## 🔍 FINDING INFORMATION

### "Where is X functionality?"
1. Check `docs/architecture/APP_JS_AUDIT_2025-10-18.md` - Complete breakdown
2. Search `src/` for the module name
3. Check `app.js` for window exposures

### "How does X work?"
1. Check relevant state manager (`src/state/`)
2. Check component module (`src/components/`)
3. Read associated docs in `docs/refactoring/`

### "What changed recently?"
1. Check `CHANGELOG.txt` for version history
2. Check `git log --oneline` for recent commits
3. Check `docs/refactoring/` for refactoring details

---

## 🚀 COMMON TASKS

### Adding a New Feature
1. Create module in appropriate `src/` subdirectory
2. Add tests for complex logic
3. Create thin wrapper in `app.js`
4. Expose to `window` if needed by HTML
5. Update this CLAUDE.md with feature description
6. Add to CHANGELOG.txt

### Fixing a Bug
1. Identify which module contains the bug
2. Fix in the module (not app.js!)
3. Test thoroughly
4. Commit with descriptive message
5. Update CHANGELOG.txt if user-facing

### Refactoring Code
1. Read `docs/refactoring/REFACTORING_LESSONS_LEARNED.md`
2. Follow existing patterns (state managers, components)
3. Use dependency injection
4. Keep app.js as thin coordinator
5. Document changes in `docs/refactoring/`

---

## ⚠️ PITFALLS TO AVOID

1. **Adding logic to app.js** - Extract to modules instead
2. **Direct state mutation** - Use state managers
3. **Global variables** - Use state managers
4. **Monolithic functions** - Break into smaller modules
5. **Skipping documentation** - Update CLAUDE.md and CHANGELOG.txt
6. **Not testing** - Always test in browser before committing

---

## 📞 GETTING HELP

### Documentation Not Clear?
- Read related docs in `docs/architecture/` and `docs/refactoring/`
- Check git history: `git log -- path/to/file`
- Check previous session handoffs in `docs/handoffs/`

### Stuck on Architecture Decision?
- Follow existing patterns (look at similar features)
- Consult `docs/architecture/APP_JS_AUDIT_2025-10-18.md`
- When in doubt: extract to module, use dependency injection

### Breaking Changes?
- Always work on feature branch
- Commit working state before experiments
- Can revert: `git reset --hard [commit-hash]`

## 🎓 UNDERSTANDING THE CODEBASE

### Key Files to Understand
1. `src/core/app.js` - Application coordinator (~1900 lines)
2. `src/state/playerStateManager.js` - Player state
3. `src/state/stemStateManager.js` - Stem state
4. `src/components/loopControls.js` - Loop functionality
5. `src/views/fileListRenderer.js` - Library view

### Key Concepts
- **Hybrid State**: Local vars + state managers
- **Dependency Injection**: Modules receive dependencies
- **Thin Wrappers**: app.js delegates to modules
- **Multi-View Architecture**: State persists across views
- **Component Modules**: Reusable, testable, isolated

---

**Remember**: This is a clean, modular codebase. Keep it that way! When in doubt, extract to a module.
