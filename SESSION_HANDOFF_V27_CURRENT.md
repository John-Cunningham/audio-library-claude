## What Was Accomplished This Session

### Phase 1: Independent Stem Playback ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Git commits**: 74f983e, 862d80c, fb62ccf

**Implemented:**
1. **Independent playback control** - Each stem can play/pause independently
2. **Master control behavior** - Parent play/pause acts as master:
   - Parent PAUSE ‚Üí pauses ALL stems
   - Parent PLAY ‚Üí resumes only stems user marked as "active"
   - Stem play/pause buttons toggle stem's active/inactive status
3. **Rate lock system** - Already existed and working perfectly:
   - Lock button toggles locked/unlocked per stem
   - Locked: stem follows parent rate
   - Unlocked: stem has independent rate
   - Visual feedback (üîí/üîì) and BPM display per stem

**Key Code Changes:**
- Added `stemPlaybackIndependent` state variable (app.js:2244)
- Modified `setupParentStemSync()` to only sync active stems (lines 2689-2735)
- Modified `toggleMultiStemPlay()` to set active/inactive flag (lines 2796-2817)
- Parent pause event captures which stems were playing and marks them active

**Testing Status**: ‚úÖ User confirmed working

### Phase 2: Basic Independent Loop Regions ‚úÖ BASIC FUNCTIONALITY COMPLETE
**Git commit**: afd396d

**Implemented:**
1. **Per-stem loop state** - `stemLoopStates` object tracks loop per stem:
   ```javascript
   stemLoopStates = {
       vocals: { enabled: false, start: null, end: null },
       drums: { enabled: false, start: null, end: null },
       bass: { enabled: false, start: null, end: null },
       other: { enabled: false, start: null, end: null }
   };
   ```

2. **Loop toggle functionality** - `toggleMultiStemLoop(stemType)`:
   - Toggles loop enabled/disabled per stem
   - Defaults to full file (0 to duration) if no loop points set
   - Updates loop button visual state (active class)

3. **Loop playback logic** - Added to timeupdate event (lines 2665-2673):
   - When playhead reaches loop end ‚Üí seeks back to loop start
   - Seamless looping per stem
   - Each stem loops independently

4. **Helper function** - `setStemLoopRegion(stemType, startTime, endTime)`:
   - Programmatically set loop start/end points
   - Exposed to global scope: `window.setStemLoopRegion`
   - For testing: `setStemLoopRegion('vocals', 5, 10)`

**Testing Status**: ‚è≥ User has not tested yet (needs page refresh)

**What's Still Missing for Phase 2:**
- Visual loop region overlay on stem waveforms (like parent player's green/blue overlay)
- Click/drag on waveform to set loop points interactively
- Loop manipulation controls (shift left/right, half/double, expand/shrink)
- Loop info display (start time, end time, duration)

## User's Original Goal (From Version 26 Handoff)

**Quote**: "Taking all of the functionality we have for our bottom player and applying it to all four of the stem players."

This means each stem should have FULL independent functionality:
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1**: Independent playback control - DONE
- ‚úÖ **Phase 1**: Independent rate control - DONE (was already working)
- üî® **Phase 2**: Independent loop regions - BASIC FUNCTIONALITY DONE
- ‚è≥ **Phase 3**: Independent markers - NOT STARTED
- ‚è≥ **Phase 4**: Independent cycle mode - NOT STARTED
- ‚è≥ **Phase 5**: Keyboard shortcuts for active stem - NOT STARTED

---

## Important Context from This Session

### User Clarification About Cycle Mode
User mentioned cycle mode is important and asked about it. Key distinction:

**Loop Mode** (what we just implemented):
- Loop button enables/disables looping
- Loop region set separately
- Just loops whatever region is set
- Parent player has this ‚úÖ

**Cycle Mode** (Phase 4, not started):
- Cycle button enables cycle mode
- When ON: Click waveform ‚Üí sets loop start, drag ‚Üí sets loop end, **auto-plays**
- Quick "click-to-loop-and-play" workflow
- Parent player has this ‚úÖ

### Future Plan: Selection System
User suggested eventually implementing a **player selection system**:
- Click on a stem/parent waveform to make it "active"
- Keyboard shortcuts affect active player
- Can select multiple players (Shift+click)
- Allows controlling 2+ stems simultaneously with parent controls

**Decision**: Implement per-stem controls first (current approach), add selection system later for advanced workflows.

---

## What to Do Next (Priority Order)

### Immediate Next Steps:

1. **User needs to test Phase 2 basic loops**:
   - Refresh localhost:5500
   - Load file with stems, expand them
   - Click LOOP button on individual stems
   - Test in console: `setStemLoopRegion('vocals', 5, 10)`
   - Verify each stem loops independently

2. **If basic loops work, complete Phase 2 visual features**:
   - Add loop region visual overlay on stem waveforms
   - Copy parent's loop region rendering code
   - Adapt for per-stem loop state
   - Add to stem waveform containers

3. **OR skip to simpler feature** (if visual rendering is complex):
   - Phase 3: Independent markers (simpler than loop visuals)
   - Phase 4: Cycle mode (user mentioned interest)

### How Parent Player Loop Visuals Work:

The parent player has loop region visuals - here's where the code is:

**Loop Region Rendering**:
- Function: `updateLoopVisuals()` (around line 3690)
- Creates visual overlay on waveform showing loop start/end
- Updates loop status display
- Shows loop duration, bar/beat count

**To Implement for Stems**:
1. Create `updateStemLoopVisuals(stemType)` function
2. Add loop region div to each stem waveform container
3. Calculate loop region position based on `stemLoopStates[stemType]`
4. Style with CSS (green/blue overlay like parent)

**Code Reference**:
- Parent loop code: app.js lines ~3690-4000
- Look for: `updateLoopVisuals()`, loop region rendering
- Copy/adapt for per-stem implementation

## Important Notes for Next Session

### Don't Break These Working Features:
- ‚úÖ Parent play/pause master control (just fixed this session)
- ‚úÖ Independent stem play/pause
- ‚úÖ Rate lock/unlock system (already perfect)
- ‚úÖ Stem volume/mute controls
- ‚úÖ Parent-stem synchronization

### Key Architecture Decisions:
- **State Management**: Using parallel objects for stems (stemLoopStates, stemPlaybackIndependent, etc.)
- **Parent Player**: Acts as "conductor" - controls timeline, stems follow
- **Independent Controls**: Each stem can override parent behavior when user manually controls it
- **Master Control**: Parent play/pause always controls ALL stems (captures playing state)

### Testing Workflow:
1. Refresh page: http://localhost:5500/index.html
2. Load file with stems (look for üéõÔ∏è icon)
3. Click STEMS button (bottom player bar)
4. Test individual stem controls
5. Use browser console for programmatic testing

---

## Questions to Ask User (if unclear):

1. **For Phase 2 completion**: Should we add visual loop overlays now, or move to Phase 3/4?
2. **For Cycle Mode (Phase 4)**: Is this higher priority than markers (Phase 3)?
3. **For Selection System**: Should we defer this until after all per-stem controls are done?

## Summary for Next Claude Session:

**Where We Are**:
- Completed Phase 1 (independent playback & rate)
- Completed Phase 2 basic functionality (loop state, toggle, playback)
- Need to either: (a) complete Phase 2 visuals, OR (b) move to Phase 3/4

**What User Wants**:
- All parent player functionality replicated in each stem
- Loop regions, markers, cycle mode all working independently per stem
- Eventually: selection system for multi-stem control

**What to Do First**:
1. Ask user to test Phase 2 basic loops (refresh page, test LOOP buttons)
2. Based on user feedback, either:
   - Complete Phase 2 visual loop overlays
   - Move to Phase 3 (markers) or Phase 4 (cycle mode)
3. Continue incrementally, test frequently, commit often

**Key Principle**:
Copy parent player functionality, adapt for per-stem state, test one feature at a time.
