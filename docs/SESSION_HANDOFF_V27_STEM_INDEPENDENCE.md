# Session Handoff: Version 27 - Independent Stem Player Controls

**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Current Branch**: experimental-v26-refactor
**Next Branch**: experimental-v27-stem-independence (create this)
**Status**: Template infrastructure complete, functionality implementation needed

---

## Context: What Was Completed in Version 26

### ‚úÖ Template System (Infrastructure Only)
Version 26 created a template/factory system that **generates HTML** for player controls:
- `src/core/playerTemplate.js` (556 lines) - Control definitions and HTML generation
- Eliminated ~300 lines of duplicated HTML code
- All 4 stem player bars now use template-generated HTML

**IMPORTANT**: This was ONLY the HTML generation layer. The actual **functionality** for independent stem controls was NOT implemented.

### Current Stem Player Limitations
Right now, stem players have:
- ‚úÖ Visual controls (buttons, sliders) - generated by template
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic play/pause/mute/volume - may work but limited
- ‚ùå **No independent loop regions** - stems follow parent loop only
- ‚ùå **No independent markers** - stems follow parent markers only
- ‚ùå **No independent metronome** - parent metronome only
- ‚ùå **No independent cycle mode** - parent cycle only
- ‚ùå **No independent rate (unlocked)** - rate lock exists but may not be fully functional
- ‚ùå **No independent keyboard shortcuts** - all shortcuts affect parent only

---

## User's Original Goal (Not Yet Achieved)

**Quote**: "Taking all of the functionality we have for our bottom player and applying it to all four of the stem players."

This means each stem should have:
1. **Independent playback control** - play/pause without affecting other stems
2. **Independent loop regions** - set different loop points per stem
3. **Independent markers** - customize marker frequency and offset per stem
4. **Independent rate control** - unlock rate from parent, adjust independently
5. **Independent cycle mode** - set and play cycles per stem
6. **Independent metronome** (optional) - each stem can have its own click track
7. **Keyboard shortcuts** - shortcuts should work for selected/active stem

---

## Version 27 Goals: Implement Independent Stem Functionality

### Phase 1: Independent Playback & Rate Control
**Priority**: HIGH - Core functionality

**Current State**:
- Stem play/pause buttons call `toggleMultiStemPlay(stemType)`
- Rate lock button exists: `toggleStemRateLock(stemType)`
- Rate sliders exist: `handleStemRateChange(stemType, value)`

**What Needs Implementation**:
1. **Independent play/pause per stem**
   - Each stem can play while others are paused
   - Parent play/pause should NOT force all stems to play
   - Visual feedback: play/pause icon per stem reflects its state

2. **Rate lock/unlock system**
   - Locked: Stem follows parent rate changes (current behavior)
   - Unlocked: Stem has independent rate, parent changes don't affect it
   - Lock button visual state (üîí locked, üîì unlocked)
   - Save locked/unlocked state per stem

3. **Independent rate adjustment**
   - When unlocked: Rate slider only affects that stem
   - Rate presets (0.5x/1x/2x) only affect that stem when unlocked
   - BPM display updates per stem's rate

**Implementation Locations**:
- `src/core/app.js` functions:
  - `toggleMultiStemPlay(stemType)` - lines ~2531-2549
  - `toggleStemRateLock(stemType)` - needs implementation
  - `handleStemRateChange(stemType, value)` - lines ~2613-2644
  - `setStemRatePreset(stemType, rate)` - needs implementation

### Phase 2: Independent Loop Regions
**Priority**: HIGH - Key feature

**Current State**:
- Loop button exists per stem: `toggleMultiStemLoop(stemType)`
- Parent has loop region system with visual overlay
- Stems currently follow parent loop only

**What Needs Implementation**:
1. **Per-stem loop region state**
   ```javascript
   // Add to app.js state
   let stemLoopStates = {
       vocals: { enabled: false, start: 0, end: 0 },
       drums: { enabled: false, start: 0, end: 0 },
       bass: { enabled: false, start: 0, end: 0 },
       other: { enabled: false, start: 0, end: 0 }
   };
   ```

2. **Loop region UI per stem**
   - Visual overlay on stem waveform (like parent)
   - Click-to-set loop points on stem waveform
   - Loop start/end time display per stem

3. **Loop controls per stem**
   - Loop toggle button enables/disables loop for that stem
   - Shift left/right buttons to adjust loop points
   - Half/Double buttons to adjust loop length
   - Expand/shrink controls per stem

4. **Independent loop playback**
   - When stem loop enabled: that stem loops at its points
   - Other stems unaffected by one stem's loop
   - Parent loop and stem loops can be different

**Implementation Pattern** (copy from parent):
- Parent loop code: lines ~3700-4000 (loop region rendering, controls)
- Copy and adapt for per-stem implementation

### Phase 3: Independent Markers
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Quality of life

**Current State**:
- Parent has markers with frequency selector (bar/beat intervals)
- Parent has shift controls to align markers
- Stems follow parent markers only

**What Needs Implementation**:
1. **Per-stem marker state**
   ```javascript
   let stemMarkerStates = {
       vocals: {
           enabled: true,
           frequency: 'bar',
           offset: 0,
           markers: []
       },
       // ... drums, bass, other
   };
   ```

2. **Marker controls per stem** (add to stem player UI)
   - Marker frequency selector (Every bar, 2 bars, beat, etc.)
   - Shift left/right buttons to adjust marker offset
   - Toggle markers on/off per stem

3. **Visual markers on stem waveforms**
   - Red bar markers at calculated positions
   - Orange beat markers (if beat frequency selected)
   - Markers update when frequency or offset changes

**Implementation Pattern**:
- Parent marker code: lines ~3200-3600
- `renderMarkers()` function
- Copy and adapt for per-stem markers

### Phase 4: Independent Cycle Mode
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Advanced feature

**Current State**:
- Parent has cycle mode (sets loop and starts playing)
- Parent has cycle controls (clear, seek on click, jump, preserve, etc.)
- Stems follow parent cycle only

**What Needs Implementation**:
1. **Per-stem cycle mode state**
   ```javascript
   let stemCycleModes = {
       vocals: { enabled: false, autoPlay: false },
       // ... drums, bass, other
   };
   ```

2. **Cycle mode button per stem**
   - Enable/disable cycle mode
   - When enabled: clicking waveform sets loop and plays
   - Visual feedback (button state)

3. **Cycle mode behavior per stem**
   - In cycle mode: click sets loop start, drag to end, auto-plays
   - Out of cycle mode: normal seek behavior
   - Each stem has independent cycle mode state

### Phase 5: Keyboard Shortcuts for Active Stem
**Priority**: LOW - Nice to have

**Current State**:
- All keyboard shortcuts affect parent player only
- No concept of "active" or "selected" stem

**What Needs Implementation**:
1. **Active stem selection**
   - Click on stem player bar to make it "active"
   - Visual feedback (highlight active stem bar)
   - One stem active at a time (or parent)

2. **Keyboard shortcuts affect active stem**
   - If parent active: shortcuts affect parent (current behavior)
   - If stem active: shortcuts affect that stem
   - Key mappings:
     - Space: Play/pause active stem
     - Shift+Left/Right: Move loop start of active stem
     - Shift+Up/Down: Move loop end of active stem
     - Up/Down: Half/double loop length of active stem
     - M: Toggle markers for active stem
     - C: Toggle cycle mode for active stem
     - L: Toggle loop for active stem

**Implementation Location**:
- Keyboard handler: lines ~5600-5900
- Add stem selection logic before keyboard actions

## Technical Approach

### State Management Strategy
Currently parent player uses global variables:
```javascript
let loopStart = 0;
let loopEnd = 0;
let loopEnabled = false;
let currentMarkers = [];
let barStartOffset = 0;
// etc.
```

For stems, create parallel state objects:
```javascript
let stemStates = {
    vocals: {
        loopStart: 0,
        loopEnd: 0,
        loopEnabled: false,
        markers: [],
        markerFrequency: 'bar',
        barStartOffset: 0,
        cycleMode: false,
        rateLocked: true,
        independentRate: 1.0
    },
    // drums, bass, other...
};
```

### UI Integration Strategy
1. **Option A**: Add controls to existing stem bars
   - Expand stem-player-rate-row with more controls
   - Add marker/cycle controls below rate controls
   - Advantage: All controls in one place
   - Disadvantage: Stems become very tall

2. **Option B**: Collapsible advanced controls per stem
   - Basic controls visible (play/mute/volume/rate)
   - "Show More" button reveals loop/marker/cycle controls
   - Advantage: Cleaner UI, progressive disclosure
   - Disadvantage: Extra click to access advanced features

3. **Option C** (Recommended): Context menu or modal per stem
   - Right-click stem or click "‚öôÔ∏è" button
   - Opens stem-specific controls panel/modal
   - Advantage: Doesn't clutter main UI
   - Disadvantage: Controls hidden behind action

### Code Duplication vs. Abstraction
Parent player has ~800 lines of loop/marker/cycle code. Rather than duplicating:

**Option 1**: Create reusable functions
```javascript
function createLoopRegion(wavesurfer, loopState) { ... }
function renderMarkers(wavesurfer, markerState) { ... }
```

**Option 2**: Create a PlayerController class
```javascript
class PlayerController {
    constructor(wavesurfer, type, name) { ... }
    setLoop(start, end) { ... }
    toggleCycle() { ... }
    renderMarkers() { ... }
}

const parentController = new PlayerController(wavesurfer, 'parent', 'Parent');
const vocalsController = new PlayerController(stemWS.vocals, 'stem', 'Vocals');
```

**Recommendation**: Start with Option 1 (functions), refactor to Option 2 (class) in Phase 6 modularization.

## Files to Modify

### Primary Implementation File
- `src/core/app.js` (main implementation)
  - Add stemStates object
  - Implement per-stem loop functions
  - Implement per-stem marker functions
  - Implement per-stem cycle functions
  - Update keyboard handler for active stem

### UI Files (if adding controls)
- `index.html` - May need to add control containers to stem bars (or keep template-generated)
- `styles/stems.css` - Style new controls, active state, expanded controls

### Template System (minimal changes)
- `src/core/playerTemplate.js` - Template already supports all controls, minimal/no changes needed

## Starting Point for Next Session

**Branch**: Create `experimental-v27-stem-independence` from `experimental-v26-refactor`

**First Tasks**:
1. Read this handoff document completely
2. Create new branch: `git checkout -b experimental-v27-stem-independence`
3. Start with Phase 1: Independent playback & rate control
4. Test incrementally after each phase
5. Commit frequently with descriptive messages

**Key Files to Examine**:
- `src/core/app.js` lines 2313-2644 (multi-stem player code)
- `src/core/app.js` lines 3700-4000 (parent loop code - to copy/adapt)
- `src/core/app.js` lines 3200-3600 (parent marker code - to copy/adapt)
- `src/core/app.js` lines 5600-5900 (keyboard handler - to extend)

**User Quote to Remember**:
> "Taking all of the functionality we have for our bottom player and applying it to all four of the stem players."

This means FULL feature parity: loop regions, markers, cycle mode, independent rate, keyboard shortcuts - everything the parent player can do, each stem should be able to do independently.

## Questions for User (Before Starting)

1. **UI Preference**: How should advanced controls be presented?
   - Expand stem bars vertically with all controls?
   - Collapsible "Show More" section per stem?
   - Right-click context menu or modal per stem?

2. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: How should user select active stem?
   - Click on stem bar to make it active?
   - Number keys 1-4 to select stems, 0 for parent?
   - Tab key to cycle through stems?

3. **Priority**: Which phases are most important?
   - Phase 1 (play/rate) seems essential
   - Phase 2 (loops) seems essential
   - Phase 3-5 (markers/cycle/keyboard) - which are most valuable?

4. **Synchronization**: Should there be a "sync all stems" button?
   - Copy parent loop to all stems?
   - Copy parent markers to all stems?
   - Copy parent rate to all stems?
