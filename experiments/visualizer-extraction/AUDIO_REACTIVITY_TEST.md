## What You Should See in Console

### When you toggle Audio Reactivity ON:

```
🎵 ========================================
🎵 AUDIO REACTIVITY TOGGLE
🎵 ========================================
🎵 New state: ON ✅
🎵 WaveSurfer exists: true
🎵 WaveSurfer playing: true/false
🎵 User enabled - triggering immediate connection attempt
🎵 Reconnect function called
🎵 ========================================
```

### Immediately after, you should see:

```
🎤 ==========================================
🎤 AUDIO ANALYZER SETUP ATTEMPT
🎤 ==========================================
🎤 Step 1: Check if WaveSurfer exists
🎤   window.wavesurfer: true
🎤   ✅ WaveSurfer found!

🎤 Step 2: Get media element
🎤   Media element: {exists: true, type: 'object', hasAudioContext: true, hasGainNode: true}

[AudioSetup] ✅ Found WaveSurfer audio context and gain node!
[AudioSetup] Analyzer created with WaveSurfer context
[AudioSetup] Attempting to connect to WaveSurfer audio graph...

🎵✅ Audio analyzer SUCCESSFULLY connected to WaveSurfer audio graph!
```

### Every 1 second while Audio Reactivity is ON:

```
[🔄 AUTO-CONNECT] Attempting audio analyzer connection...
[🔄 AUTO-CONNECT] Reactivity: true | Connected: false | WaveSurfer: true
```

(This stops once connected)

## What To Check

### 1. Bass/Mids/Highs Numbers

With audio playing and Audio Reactivity ON:
- **Current Amplitude**: should show values (not 0.00)
- **Bass**: should show values (not 0.00)
- **Mids**: should show values (not 0.00)
- **Highs**: should show values (not 0.00)

### 2. Particles Reacting

- Particles should pulse/scale with audio
- Try different frequency modes (Bass/Mids/Highs/All)
- Adjust strength slider - should see more/less reaction

### 3. File Changes

- Click different particles to load different files
- Audio reactivity should STAY WORKING
- No need to toggle off/on again

---

## If You See Problems

### Problem: No emoji logs appear

**Cause**: Browser cache still serving old JavaScript

**Fix**:
1. Close DevTools
2. **Quit and restart Chrome completely**
3. Reopen page
4. Open DevTools
5. Network tab → ✅ Disable cache
6. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
7. Try again

### Problem: "WaveSurfer not found"

**Cause**: No audio file loaded yet

**Fix**:
1. Go to Library View
2. Load an audio file
3. **Then** switch to Galaxy View
4. **Then** toggle Audio Reactivity

### Problem: Numbers still 0.00

**Cause 1**: Audio not playing
- Click play button to start audio

**Cause 2**: Audio connected but volume too low
- Increase volume slider
- Increase "Reactivity Strength" slider

**Cause 3**: Connection failed
- Look for error in console
- Copy/paste ALL console output from when you toggled

### Problem: Works but breaks when clicking particles

**Cause**: This should be fixed now with continuous auto-connect

**What to check**:
- After clicking particle, wait 1-2 seconds
- Should see auto-connect logs
- Should reconnect automatically

## What To Send Me

### If it works:
```
✅ Audio Reactivity working!
✅ Numbers updating (Bass/Mids/Highs not 0.00)
✅ Particles reacting to audio
✅ Stays working when clicking different particles
```

### If it doesn't work:
Copy **ENTIRE console output** starting from when you:
1. Hard refreshed
2. Toggled Audio Reactivity ON
3. Through any errors that appear

Make sure to include:
- The 🎵 toggle logs
- The 🎤 setup logs
- Any ❌ error messages

## Summary

**Key requirement**: **HARD REFRESH** (Cmd+Shift+R) with cache disabled

**Test sequence**:
1. Hard refresh
2. Load audio in Library View
3. Switch to Galaxy View
4. Toggle Audio Reactivity ON
5. Check for emoji logs in console

**Expected result**:
- See 🎵 and 🎤 emoji logs
- See "SUCCESSFULLY connected"
- Bass/Mids/Highs show real numbers
- Particles react to audio
