# Supabase QUIC Protocol Error - Fixed

## Problem

When loading audio files from Supabase storage, browser console showed:
```
GET https://ekpsbioieoxhdjdqwohy.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/audio-files/[filename].mp3
net::ERR_QUIC_PROTOCOL_ERROR 200 (OK)
```

This prevented audio files from loading in:
- Library View (mini waveforms)
- Main player (WaveSurfer)
- Stem players (all stems)

## Root Cause

**Chrome HTTP/3 QUIC Protocol Issue**

Chrome by default uses HTTP/3 with QUIC protocol for connections. Sometimes this fails with certain servers (including Supabase), even though the server returns 200 OK. The QUIC handshake fails, preventing the file from loading.

This is a known issue with:
- Browser HTTP/3 implementation
- Network/firewall interference
- Stale connection cache

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Robust Audio Fetch Utility

**File**: `visualizer-extraction-src/utils/audioFetch.js` (NEW)

Features:
- **Automatic retry** with exponential backoff (3 attempts: 1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- **Cache bypass** on retry attempts to force fresh connection
- **Timeout protection** (30 second timeout per attempt)
- **Detailed logging** to diagnose connection issues
- **CORS configuration** for Supabase storage
- **Helpful error messages** with fix suggestions

### 2. Updated All Audio Loading Code

**Files Modified**:

1. **miniWaveform.js** - Library View mini waveforms
   - Import: `loadAudioIntoWaveSurfer` utility
   - Updated: Lines 18, 90-95
   - Context: `MiniWaveform`

2. **fileLoader.js** - Main audio player
   - Import: `loadAudioIntoWaveSurfer` utility
   - Updated: Lines 16, 103-109
   - Context: `FileLoader`
   - Error UI: Shows error message in player on failure

3. **stemPlayerManager.js** - All stem players
   - Import: `loadAudioIntoWaveSurfer` utility
   - Updated: Lines 18, 314-318, 443-446, 729-732
   - Contexts: `StemPlayer-{type}`, `StemPlayerLegacy-{type}`, `StemPlayerIndependent-{type}`

### 3. How It Works

**Before** (Direct WaveSurfer load):
```javascript
wavesurfer.load(file.file_url); // ‚ùå Single attempt, fails on QUIC error
```

**After** (Robust fetch with retry):
```javascript
loadAudioIntoWaveSurfer(wavesurfer, file.file_url, 'FileLoader')
    .catch(error => {
        console.error('[FileLoader] Failed to load:', error);
    });
```

**Process**:
1. Attempt 1: Try fetch with normal cache
2. If fails ‚Üí Wait 1s
3. Attempt 2: Try fetch with cache bypass
4. If fails ‚Üí Wait 2s
5. Attempt 3: Try fetch with cache bypass
6. If all fail ‚Üí Try direct WaveSurfer load as last resort
7. Show helpful error message with fix instructions

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Verify Auto-Retry Works

1. **Hard refresh** browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Open DevTools** Console tab
3. **Load any audio file**
4. **Look for logs**:
   ```
   [FileLoader] üì° Fetch attempt 1/3 for filename.mp3
   [FileLoader] ‚úÖ Successfully fetched filename.mp3 (attempt 1)
   [FileLoader] ‚úÖ Audio loaded into WaveSurfer successfully
   ```

### Test 2: Verify Mini Waveforms Load

1. Go to **Library View**
2. **Scroll through file list**
3. **Check console** for:
   ```
   [MiniWaveform] üì° Fetch attempt 1/3 for filename.mp3
   [MiniWaveform] ‚úÖ Successfully fetched filename.mp3 (attempt 1)
   ```
4. Mini waveforms should render correctly

### Test 3: Verify Stem Loading

1. **Load a file with stems**
2. **Open stem player**
3. **Check console** for:
   ```
   [StemPlayer-vocals] üì° Fetch attempt 1/3 for filename-vocals.mp3
   [StemPlayer-vocals] ‚úÖ Successfully fetched filename-vocals.mp3 (attempt 1)
   ```
4. All 4 stems should load correctly

### Test 4: Verify Retry on Failure

If you still see QUIC errors, you should now see retry attempts:
```
[FileLoader] üì° Fetch attempt 1/3 for filename.mp3
[FileLoader] üîå QUIC protocol error on attempt 1 (known browser issue)
[FileLoader] üîÑ Retrying in 1000ms...
[FileLoader] üì° Fetch attempt 2/3 for filename.mp3
[FileLoader] ‚úÖ Successfully fetched filename.mp3 (attempt 2)
```

## Alternative Fix (If Auto-Retry Doesn't Solve It)

### Disable QUIC in Chrome

If the retry logic still can't connect, you can disable HTTP/3 QUIC in Chrome:

1. Open new tab: `chrome://flags/#enable-quic`
2. Set "Experimental QUIC protocol" to **DISABLED**
3. **Restart Chrome completely** (quit and reopen)
4. Try loading audio files again

This forces Chrome to use HTTP/2 instead of HTTP/3 QUIC.

### Clear Browser Storage

If disabling QUIC doesn't work:

1. Open **DevTools** (Cmd+Option+I)
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. Click **"Clear storage"** in left sidebar
4. Click **"Clear site data"** button
5. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)

## Expected Behavior

### Success Case
- Audio files load normally
- Console shows successful fetch on attempt 1
- No error messages
- Mini waveforms render
- Main player loads audio
- Stems load correctly

### Retry Case (Transient Network Issue)
- First attempt fails (QUIC error)
- Waits 1-2 seconds
- Retry succeeds
- Audio loads normally
- Console shows retry logs

### Persistent Failure Case
- All 3 attempts fail
- Fallback direct load attempted
- If fallback fails, error shown:
  ```
  [FileLoader] ‚ùå Failed to fetch filename.mp3 after 3 attempts: Failed to fetch
  [FileLoader] üí° This appears to be a browser HTTP/3 QUIC protocol issue.
  [FileLoader] üí° Try disabling QUIC: chrome://flags/#enable-quic ‚Üí Set to DISABLED ‚Üí Restart Chrome
  ```
- User shown helpful instructions in console

   fix: Add robust retry logic for Supabase QUIC protocol errors

   - Created audioFetch.js utility with exponential backoff retry
   - Updated all audio loading (main player, mini waveforms, stems)
   - Auto-retries 3 times with cache bypass on failure
   - Helpful error messages with fix instructions

   Fixes audio loading failures with ERR_QUIC_PROTOCOL_ERROR
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still seeing QUIC errors even with retries

**Solution**: Disable QUIC in Chrome (see "Alternative Fix" above)

### Issue: Audio loads but very slowly

**Cause**: Retry delays adding up (1s + 2s = 3s extra delay)

**Expected**: This only happens when connections fail. Successful loads are instant.

### Issue: Console flooded with retry logs

**Cause**: Multiple files loading simultaneously, all retrying

**Not a bug**: Each file logs its retry attempts. This is helpful for diagnosis.

### Issue: Stems fail but main player works

**Cause**: Stems are 4 separate files, more opportunities for QUIC failures

**Expected**: Each stem retries independently. Check logs for which stem failed.

## Related Issues

This fix resolves:
- ‚ùå ERR_QUIC_PROTOCOL_ERROR when loading audio files
- ‚ùå Mini waveforms not rendering in Library View
- ‚ùå Main player showing "Failed to load" errors
- ‚ùå Stems failing to load silently

This does NOT resolve:
- Network/internet connectivity issues (will still fail after retries)
- Supabase storage bucket access issues (requires Supabase config fix)
- Browser completely offline (no amount of retry will help)
