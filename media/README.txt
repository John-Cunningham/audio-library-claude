Place a few small audio files here for local testing to avoid CORS issues.
For example:
- media/drums.mp3
- media/bass.mp3
- media/vocals.mp3
- media/other.mp3

Then update or keep the auto-wired STEMS to point to these files:
  ./media/drums.mp3
  ./media/bass.mp3
  ./media/vocals.mp3
  ./media/other.mp3
